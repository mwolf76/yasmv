TODO

* Refactor exceptions system-wide;

* Implement symmetric four-way reachability/closure analysis as follows:

(a) forward reachability witness search;
(b) forward unreachability proof search;
(c) backward reachability witness search;
(d) backward unreachability proof search.

----------

Introduce support for timed constraints (AT-expressions)

(a)
AT 0
   x = 0;

is equivalent to:
INIT
    x = 0;

(b)
AT 0 .. *
   x = 0;

is equivalent to:
INVAR
     x = 0;

(c)
AT 3 .. 5
   x = 0;

is a constraint only valid when analyzing the transition relation for k = { 3, 4, 5 };

AT <from> ( .. <to> )?
   <expr>

----------

* Add support for guarded transitions

(a) add support for assignment in TRANS sections only; assignments are
not to be accepted in the context of INIT and INVAR or DEFINE sections;

in TRANSes, '<identifier> :=' is equivalent to 'next(<identifier>) =
'. The preprocessor takes on the duty of rewriting the original
expression into the equivalent lower-level one.

we pone the explicit restriction that <identifier> must be a state
variable identifier; this is necessary to implement mutual-exclusion
all the guarded claues talking about variable `x`.

(b) add support for guarded transitions semantics in TRANS
section. Guarded transitions are a generalization of ordinary TRANSes. The
grammar of a guarded transition is as follows:

TRANS
<guard> ':'
        ( <state-var> := <expr> ';' ) +

In particular, multiple assignments are supported under the same
guard. This is just a shortcut to allow the user to express something like:

TRANS
running:
        x := x + 1;
        y := y - 1;

instead of having to write two separate TRANS sections.

TRANS
running:
        x := x + 1;

TRANS
running:
        y := y - 1;

-- when guard is true, the assignment clause applies
TRANS
guard:
        <state-variable> := <rhs-expr>;

-- the former semantics is preserved with a backward-compatible syntax
TRANS
        <state-variable> := <rhs-expr>;

the latter is equivalent to:

TRANS
TRUE:
        <state-variable> := <rhs-expr>;

(c) Auto frame condition generation

Upon model compilation(?TODO review and redefine model processing
phases?) all guards for each state-variable are analyzed for mutual
exclusion; For each variable, if any two guards g1 and g2 are found to
be compatible (i.e. ! UNSAT(g1, g2)) an error in generated and the
compilation process is halted.

If the guard analysis for g1, g2, ... gk is completed without
reporting an error, a final clause is generated:

g0 ::= ! g1 & ! g2 & ... & ! gk

One final TRANS is automatically added to the model:
TRANS
g0:
        <state-variable> := <state-variable>

This is called a frame condition. A frame conditions implements the
basic inertial principle so that a variable which is not assigned a
new value retains its previous value. This, any variable is expected
to retain its value unless a relevant (for that variable) TRANS is
taken by the FSM.

Review doxygen docs. It would be nice to have some documentation for
the language too.
